Ryan Durnan Lab8 Submission

This lab required me to implement important functions for binary trees. Such functions included finding
the size of the tree, the height of the tree, the numbers of leaves on the tree, the value of the 
leftmost leaf, and the postorder traversal of the tree.

Additionally, I modified one of the given files - BinaryTreeDriver.cpp - so that it recognized the 
command for postorder traversals, printing necessary data out accordingly.
